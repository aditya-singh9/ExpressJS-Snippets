| app.render   | Returns the rendered HTML of a view via the callback function. It accepts an optional parameter that is an object containing local variables for the view.                          |

| app.set      | Assigns setting name to value, where name is one of the properties from the app settings table.                                                                                     |

| app.catchAll | Define a catch all route for all the invalid requests.                                                             |
